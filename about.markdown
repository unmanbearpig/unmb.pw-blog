Hi I'm Ivan, unmanbearpig on some social media like GitHub.

I program in Rails for work and Rust and other languages for fun.

I love and hate computers and try to figure out how they work on low and high
level. Also interested in security, privacy and social aspects of technology.

This website is very much work in progress, and I hope to add more content
here soon. So stay tuned and subscribe to my RSS
